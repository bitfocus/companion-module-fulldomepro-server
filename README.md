# companion-module-fulldomepro-server
This module was written based on the generic-OSC module.
It is my first attempt at developing a Companion module and in reality its my first serious attempt at developing anything. It is by no means perfect and I'm certain there are probably better ways to do things, but it works.

I plan to add more features to this soon but for now I want to get it out there so it can be used.

I am open to suggestions and feedback.
